# Real-Estate--Multiple-Linear-Regression
This project's objective is to construct a multiple linear regression model for a housing dataset, enabling the prediction of house prices using various potential predictor variables. 

The process begins by reading and visualizing the data, followed by data preparation for linear modeling, addressing challenges such as categorical variable handling, dummy variable introduction, and scaling techniques. The model will be systematically developed, employing a bottom-up approach starting with a single variable and progressively incorporating more. Once all variables are included, the project covers manual feature elimination, residual analysis, and prediction methods.
